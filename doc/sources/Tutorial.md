# Tutorial: Setoids

A _setoid_ is a type equipped with an equivalence relation. Setoids come up when
you need types with a better behaved equality relation, or when you want the
equality relation to carry additional information. After completing this
tutorial you will:

1. Know the user interface to the `setoid` package.
2. Know two different applications in which it can be used:
  + constructing types with an equality relation that's better behaved than
    Idris's built-in `Equal` type.

  + types with an equality relation that carries additional information
